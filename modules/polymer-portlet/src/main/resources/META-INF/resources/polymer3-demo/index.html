      The purpose of this HTML is to give the entry for compilation and serve only JS,
      Actual UI tags would be used by JSP which along with tag will serve component instance data as html attribute.
      See the bottom of ../view.jsp

      For development use http://127.0.0.1:8081/index-develop.html
      which has all parts of page (stripped off here) and instantiates <polymer3-demo-app> component.

      The `<base>` tag below and JS URLs will be recompiled by build.sh
      The tag is going to be removed and JS will be served with URL reset in build.sh
      i.e. /o/polymer-portlet/polymer3-demo/build/$1/
